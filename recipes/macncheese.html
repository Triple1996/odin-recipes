        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Macaroni and cheese</strong>—also called <strong>mac and cheese</strong>in the United States, 
            and <strong>macaroni cheese</strong> in the United Kingdom—is a dish of cooked macaroni 
            pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar. It can also incorporate 
            other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs or meat.</p>

        <p>
            Traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, 
            it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. 
            The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay 
            sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered 
            a comfort food.

                <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 cups milk</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                        Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring 
                        occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 
                        8 minutes. Drain.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, 
                        salt, and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour 
                        milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring until 
                        mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese 
                        to milk mixture and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.
                    </p>
