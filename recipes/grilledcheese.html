        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>toasted sandwich</strong>, <strong>grilled cheese sandwich</strong>, 
            <strong>cheese toastie</strong>, or <strong>grilled cheese</strong> is a 
            hot sandwich (toastie) made with one or more varieties of cheese (a cheese sandwich)
            on bread. It is typically prepared by heating one or more slices of cheese between 
            slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as butter, on a frying pan, griddle, or 
            sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts. A grilled cheese 
            may contain ingredients besides the bread and cheese, as long as the latter is the
            main focus.
